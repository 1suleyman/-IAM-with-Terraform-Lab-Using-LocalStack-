# -IAM-with-Terraform-Lab-Using-LocalStack-
In this lab, I learned how to deploy IAM resources using Terraform, configure the AWS provider to work with LocalStack, fix provider authentication issues, and dynamically create multiple IAM users using the count meta-argument. This lab mirrors real AWS IAM provisioning but uses a mock environment for safe experimentation.
